I am big fan of computer shortcuts and try and inculcate as many as I can in my daily workflows. So far I have been focussed on being productive in the desktop tools that I use daily.

Comimg to Browsers, they are the gateway to internet and more and more tools are browser native and its increasing as we speak. Right from IDE's(Development environments) like [vscode](https://github.dev), Communication tools like [teams](https://teams.microsoft.com)/[slack](https://slack.com), Documentation platforms like [Microsoft Docs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word)/[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com)/[Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel)/[Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com), Mail Platforms like [Office 365](https://outlook.office.com/)/[Gmail](https://gmail.com) to the Latest LLM's [Microsoft Co-Pilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)/[Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/), most run on browser and can be used by one and all.

I have been using some shortcuts like [sheets.new](https://sheets.new) and [docs.new](https://docs.new) and I was looking to see if there are more such shortcuts that can be used.

One can setup url shortener's as shortcut to application url's , but that needs some work and maintenance.

Today, I would like to share few shortcuts that are already public and set by companies themselves and are available for one and all to use. The suffix is .new (same for all), prefix is a noun/verb.

### Here is a list of compiled url shortcuts:
