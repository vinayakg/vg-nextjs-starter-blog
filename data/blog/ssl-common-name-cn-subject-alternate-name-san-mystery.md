üîí **Exploring SSL Certificates and SANs: Unveiling the Mystery!** üîí

Ever wondered why SSL certificates sometimes have a different Common Name (CN) than the domain name? Here's the scoop:

1. üåê **SANs Take the Lead:** Browsers prioritize names from Subject Alternate Names (SAN) over CN. SAN can host multiple domain names and IP addresses.

2. üöÄ **CN is Plan B:** If no match in SAN, browsers check CN. But don't fret if CN differs, especially in shared hosting situations ‚Äì it's about trust, not just names.

3. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Check Your Cert:** Use this OpenSSL command to inspect CN, SAN, and more:

`sh openssl s_client -connect [yourdomain.com:443](http://yourdomain.com:443/) 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -text | grep -E "CN=|DNS:|IP Address:|Purpose:|Public Key:|Not Before:|Not After:" `

4. üåü **Firebase Example:** Google Firebase might show a different CN, but with a whopping 100 SAN DNS entries. Impressive!

5. üõ°Ô∏è **Maximize SAN Entries:** Remember, the maximum SAN entries per Let's Encrypt certificate are around 100.
